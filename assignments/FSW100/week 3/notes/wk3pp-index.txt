            <h3>The nickname "HOG"</h3>
            <p>A bunch of farm boys who consistently won races in the 1920’s became known as the "hog boys". They had a hog as their mascot and would put the hog on their Harley  after winning a race and take what they call a victory  lap. In 1983, Harley Davidson took the name “HOG” and turned that name into an acronym naming it Harley Owners Group. </p>
