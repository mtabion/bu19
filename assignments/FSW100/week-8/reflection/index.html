        <h1>Melvin Tabion</h1>
        <h5 class="full-stack">Full Stack  Web Developer - Bryan University</h5>
        <p class="para"> I aspire to write and understand codes comfortably and effectively like an experienced web developer. I want
            people to recognize me as the person that is a resource to help them accomplish their projects. I really
            enjoyed the last assignment I did which was the capstone project. It made me realize how a business type
            website is generally built under pressure as I had worked on it till the last minute. l was able to utilize
            all the tools I’ve learned in this course. The Capstone project has built up my confidence in web
            developing. 
            At first I didn’t know what to expect to accomplish in this course or even be interested in it. But at the
            end of this course it gave me confirmation on something I really like doing, either as a career or as a
            hobby. After doing that career exploration worksheet I realized that most companies requirements is exactly
            what we are learning right now which will help me in my future goals in becoming a successful web developer.
            At the completion of my course, I want to be able to work for Amazon, Google or any company that will allow
            me to work remotely from home or anywhere in the world.
