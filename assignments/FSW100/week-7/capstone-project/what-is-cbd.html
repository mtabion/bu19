                <p id="hempworx">HempWorx products are made from industrial hemp plants grown on American farms.
                    Cannabidiol (CBD), a
                    constituent that naturally occurs in industrial Hemp, is just one of over 85 cannabinoids that is
                    identified in the cannabis plant. Our oil is CO2 extracted resulting in a solvent free, pure
                    product.

                    The Endocannabinoid System (ECS), an extension of our Central Nervous System, is comprised of
                    receptors, neurotransmitters and enzymes. The ECS interacts with Cannabinoids found in the Cannabis
                    plant and Encocannabinoids that are produced by our own bodies.

                    HempWorx products contain CBD and other Cannabinoids which bind to the ECS receptors leading to a
                    positive impact on health and overall well-being.</p>

                <p id="thc">THC</p>
                <P id="cannibis">Cannabis is a family of plants with two primary classifications - Indica and Sativa.
                    While marijuana can be considered a member of either the Indica or Sativa families, Hemp is a member
                    of the Cannabis Sativa family.

                    Because Hemp and Marijuana both derive from the Cannabis Sativa family, they do share certain
                    similarities; however, due to each plant's biological structure, they have several very distinct and
                    crucial differences.</P>

                <p class="h2">CBD</p>
                <p class="compound">Cannabis contains a variety of different compounds called Cannabinoids, two of the
                    richest and most dominant are Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD).


                    Both Cannabinoids have shown to provide profound benefits to the human body; however, THC induces
                    psychoactive effects (gets the user "high"), while CBD does not contain any psychoactive properties.
