            <p id="p4">"I received my sample kit & tried the Hempworx 500 for the very 1st time! 2 drops last night & 2
                this morning.
                I was skeptical & didn’t know what to expect, but I am literally AMAZED at the noticeable difference in
                my ENERGY level overnight. I can’t wait to explore & experience the benefits of a consistent regimen!
                Thank you, for the introduction, and more importantly for the PERSONAL consultations & reassurances.
                You’ve made me a BELIEVER!"</p>

            <p>"I slept 6hrs straight last night. I got up then went back to bed thinking I'd sleep awhile longer but
                while I was laying in bed this morning wanting to go back to sleep I noticed that I had my hands under
                my pillow. It got me thinking how I use to have to sleep with my arms parallel to my sides and my legs
                straight not bent because if either one was bent, they would wake me up about every 2hrs hurting and
                sooo stiff. It would literally hurt to straighten them out and my hips would about killed me. I bought a
                memory foam mattress topper a few yrs ago and it helped my hips but then it got old and I tossed it a
                few months ago. Ugh, I hated tossing it because my mattress needs replaced bad so I just knew that my
                hips were going to kill me. Nope. My hips don't bother me at all! I'm not waking up every 2hrs hurting
                and stiff.</p>

            <p>Testimonial of my 89-year-old Mom ~ I started giving my Mom 5 drops am and pm 2 months ago. She had major
                signs of old age memory loss. She could not remember dates she would ask me minimum 3x a day questions I
                had already answered, she would sleep all day and be up all night.
                Well, she is now as swift as when she was 85 remembers her dates talks about yesterday with
                recollection. Sleeps Nights and up through the day. My sister was talking to my Mom last week over the
                phone then asked to talk to me and said: "Mary, do not ever take Mom off that oil, my gosh, she
                remembers everything like she used to!" After I hung up the phone I had tears of joy! Also, I noticed my
                Mothers eyes are crystal clear. I want to thank God for giving us this amazing plant! I have My mom back
                and she is no longer in the sadness of this horrible sickness</p>

            <p>I started taking this oil in mid June. I am almost finished with my first bottle and decided it was time
                to share the way it has helped me.
                I have severe problems with my lower back, and I’ve had discomfort for the past 7 or so years. I’ve had
                other things that I was taking fairly regularly and I’ve had little results. I’m now taking 8 drops of
                this twice daily, and the results are amazing! I have taken 2 of my other things since I started this
                and that was more as a precaution than anything else. Week before last, I played two 18 hole rounds of
                golf absolutely discomfort free! In the past, I would have taken the other things before and again that
                night, and been miserable for several days after. This time it was so different! I had ZERO discomfort
                during and after playing. I’m sleeping better, as I’m not tossing and turning to find a comfortable
                position that's not making me hurt. . I can pick up my grand babies and play with them all day, without
                aches. I’m so excited with the results of the this and I thank God that I no longer have to take any the
                other things for my back!</p>

            <p>Like many women, I battled dark moments in my life. For years, nothing worked for me, so I began my
                research on CBD. this research led me to Hempworx 750 Natural CBD oil. For the first time in my life I
                felt alive, happy and free from the pressures of life! After my experience, I decided to partner with
                HempWorx to allow the world to experience what so many other people are already experiencing."</p>

            <p>After trying other CBD companies and not being satisfied, I was hesitant to give Hempworx a try. But with
                their 60-day money back guarantee, I felt it was a risk free. I was so excited when the product was
                working more than I was expected! A quality CBD product is so important especially if you are giving it
                to love ones! Hempworx has changed my family's quality of life and gave us peace of mind. Hempworx, a
                quality product, affordable and sourced from the USA!</p>

            <p> "Mental prison is where I used to live.... Recently I went on a woman’s Christian walk for an entire
                weekend. During this walk they did a dinner where all the people working did a fun dance, and at the end
                they invited all of us to come up and dance with them. This is the time I would typically slowly slip to
                the back where no one could see me, fake smiling and clapping trying to force myself to act
                comfortable when all I wanted to do was run away and HIDE! This time was different. I went right up
                without even thinking, without fighting my own self conscious thoughts- got front row and center and
                DANCED like no one was watching. I felt FREE! I felt like I could finally be ME! I didn’t even have
                one anxious thought run through my mind- just pure joy that was saturated with smiles, laughter, and
                dance moves!</p>
